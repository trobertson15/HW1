				Hello world!
				My name is Tyler Robertson
				I did this assignment last semester in BPA so it is nice to have the refresher with using git and github. The class so far seems like it will be informative and I will get enjoyment out of it. The professor dumbs stuff down to a level everyone can understand and shows step-by-step of how to do something. I like this method of teaching; it enhances my learning.
